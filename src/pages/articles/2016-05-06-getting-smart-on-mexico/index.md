Howdy folks.

Apologies for the long time with no follow-up. I guess starting a graduate dual-degree program keeps you busy? Who knew.

Since I haven’t had a lot of time lately, I’m going to keep this post short and give you guys an overview of what to read and who to follow if you want to catch up on the Mexico VC and telecom worlds. By no means is this list exhaustive, so give a shout with anything I missed.

Cheers –

Will
